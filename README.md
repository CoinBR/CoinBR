### Hi there, I'm Pedro 👋

I am a **Lead Engineer** currently working on Risk and Fraud prevention systems at **PayPal**. I specialize in migrating monoliths to microservices and building high-performance financial architectures.

Because most of my work is proprietary and enterprise-grade, my public activity here is limited.

#### 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **Languages:** Java (Quarkus, Spring Boot), Python, Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript.
*   **Shell/CLI:** Bash, Zsh, Oil Shell (I love automating workflows).
*   **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
*   **Core Focus:** Microservices, SOA, TDD, and High-Availability Systems.

#### 🚀 Highlights
*   **PayPal:** Reduced fraud losses by 30% and deployment times by 80% via microservices migration.
*   **Meritize:** Built an Advanced Loan Origination Service from scratch; optimized E2E testing speeds by 3x.
*   **Open Source:** I have a deep love for Linux/Unix environments and CLI tools.
